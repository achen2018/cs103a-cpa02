This app is supposed to be used to request rides and view recipes.

In order to request a ride, users will be able to enter their name, where to be picked up, where to
be dropped off, and an optional message. If their pickup or location is the airport or train station, users would be required to enter how much luggage they are traveling and what time is their departure or arrival time.
